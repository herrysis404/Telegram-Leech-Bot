## FAQ

* [Only work with direct link for now] It is like u can add custom name as prefix of the original file name.
Like if your file name is `gk.txt` uploaded will be what u add in `CUSTOM_FILE_NAME` + `gk.txt`

Only works with direct link.No magnet or torrent.

And also added custom name like...

You have to pass link as 
`www.download.me/gk.txt | new.txt`

The file will be uploaded as `new.txt`.


## How to Use?

* Send any one of the available command, as a reply to a valid link.

* Files Larger than 1500MB are splitted into parts, and uploaded to Telegram group. To join the files, Download all the parted files, place them in the same directory.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Windows < 10 Users: 
  
  `Extract the contents of Hl-join.zip into the directory where splited parts of a file are placed, and run the the join32.exe to join the files.`
  
  `Hl-join.zip Location : This repository/hl-join/hl-join.zip`
  
  ðŸ‘‰ GNU/Linux Users: 
  
  `cat filename.00001 filename.00002 filename.00003 > filename`
   Replace filename in the above command, as required.
  
* If you got a file.tar.gz from the bot:

  ðŸ‘‰ Windown 10 Users : 
  
  `Install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)`
  
  `Extract the .tar.gz file.`
  
  ðŸ‘‰ GNU/Linux users : 
  
  `Just right click and select "Extract Here" if you use Ubuntu.`
